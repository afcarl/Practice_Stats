Evaluating distributions:
    - Null hypothesis is typically two distributions are the same
    - Reject the null hypothesis = the two distributions are different
    - Threshold for p-value analysis typically around 5% and can range between 1-10%
    - Depends on the distributions being compared and what level is required to confirm difference

[2 Sample Komogorov-Smirnov Test](http://www.physics.csbsju.edu/stats/KS-test.html) (aka: KS Test): 
    - Determine if two datasets differ significantly. Used for continuous distribution
    - Does not make assumptions about distributions of data
    - Non-parametric & distribution free
    - D stat = max vertical distance between two distributions (smaller is better)
    - p value = low leads to believing the two distributions are different

[Student's t-Test]() (t-Test):
    - Determine if two datasets are differ or from same distribution
    - Handles problems associated iwth inference based on "small" samples 
    - Accomodate calculated mean could deviate from real mean 
    - p value = low leads to supporting the two distributions are different
